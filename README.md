# authorverifyr

----THIS PACKAGE IS IN DEVELOPMENT AND IS THE WORK OF A PHD PROJECT----

## Overview

This package is used to complete the task of Author Analysis, specifically the task of Author Verification, which is the topic of my PhD programme. This package will be the culmination of my research into past methodologies as well as any methods I create myself.

## Installation

This package is still in development and will probably remain a work in progress for the duration of my course.

``` r
# Install the development version from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("BenJCross1995/authorverifyr")
```

## Features

There are several major features within the package, each of these features has its own script. For this reason I will go into detail about each script within the R folder.
